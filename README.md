# üè¶ Financial bank application

## Financial bank is an app that deals with importation and analysis of possible fraud transactions.

<br>

# üí° About

* It is divided in separate modules who are able to communicate amongst themselves by use of kafka messaging.

* It uses a MySQL database to store information of users and transactions

* It accepts transactions in two formats, csv and xml.

To be able to make imports, the user is required to be logged-in, for showcase purposes there is a default user,
in case a user does not have an account, sign-up is possible, which will require email verification from the user,
but that requires a .env file with ENV_EMAIL and ENV_PASSWORD [setup](https://github.com/Corygoncrg/financial.bank/edit/master/README.md#--setup).

After logging in, the user will be able to go to the import page, and start making imports, or check for suspect transactions.

# üìù  Setup

There is one necessary step for the users module to be runnable, that is to create a .env file in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml

Inside that .env file you will add and fill the necessary fields:
* ENV_EMAIL=
* ENV_PASSWORD=

It will look like this:

the email field is filled with your email.

The password field must be filled with an app password. Here is a link for the Google support regarding app passwords and how to create them.

*If you are not using gmail, look for the corresponding service from your email provider.

Once you are done setting up the .env file, you can run the docker-compose.yaml, the frontend page is http://localhost:5500 by default.
